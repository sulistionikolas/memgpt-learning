       "[\"[LLM]  Here's a recipe for a classic Lasagna Verde (Spinach Lasagna) with a few tweaks to make it more gourmet, inspired by the Michelin-starred Italian cuisine. This dish is rich, flavorful, and has a beautiful presentation.\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n\\n* 1 lb fresh spinach leaves\\n* 2 lbs fresh pasta dough (lasagna sheets)\\n* 3 cups whole milk\\n* 1 cup heavy cream\\n* 1 lb Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, finely grated\\n* 1 lb Mortadella, finely sliced\\n* 1 lb Prosciutto di Parma, thinly sliced\\n* 2 lbs fresh ricotta cheese\\n* 4 large eggs\\n* Salt and black pepper to taste\\n* Nutmeg, freshly grated, to taste\\n* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter\\n* 1 small onion, finely chopped\\n* 1 clove garlic, minced\\n* 1 cup dry white wine\\n* 2 cups chicken stock\\n* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour\\n* Extra virgin olive oil, for drizzling\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1.

Remove from heat and stir in half of the grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\\n\\n5. In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, eggs, spinach puree, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Mix well.\\n\\n6. To assemble the lasagna: Spread a thin layer of b√©chamel sauce at the bottom of a large baking dish. Arrange 3-4 lasagna sheets on top, followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture, slices of Mortadella and Prosciutto, and more b√©chamel sauce. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used up, ending with a final layer of b√©chamel sauce.\\n\\n7. Drizzle olive oil over the top layer and sprinkle with remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.\\n\\n8. Bake in a preheated oven at 350¬∞F (180¬∞C) for about 40 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbly. Let it rest for a few minutes before serving.\\n\\n9.
